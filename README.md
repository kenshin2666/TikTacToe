# TikTacToe
Gotta learn!

Time to solve Alex's TikTacToe puzzle game :D! 

Things to work on:

checkColumns() doesnt print [2][2] for some reason (bug)
Create class to diagonal win condition
Create a little pop up when there's a winner
Clean up absurd amount of println statements
Finish the reset function
Clean up rest of code
Add menu data
